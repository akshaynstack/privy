# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Privy team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### üìß How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:
1. Email security details to the maintainers (privately)
2. Include detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
3. Provide the impact assessment
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

### üö® What Qualifies as a Security Issue

- Authentication bypasses
- Authorization flaws
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, Command)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Information disclosure
- Remote code execution
- Denial of service (DoS)
- API key/credential exposure

### ‚ö° Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity (critical issues prioritized)

### üõ° Security Best Practices

When using Privy in production:

#### Environment Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Regularly rotate API keys and passwords

#### API Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting (built-in)
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Validate all input data
- Use proper CORS settings

#### Infrastructure Security
- Keep PostgreSQL and Redis updated
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Monitor system logs
- Use intrusion detection systems
- Regular security audits

#### Application Security
- Keep Python dependencies updated
- Use security scanning tools
- Implement proper logging (without secrets)
- Use secure session management
- Validate JWT tokens properly

### üîç Security Scanning

We recommend regular security scanning:

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
pip install safety
safety check

# Code security analysis
pip install bandit
bandit -r app/

# Static analysis
pip install semgrep
semgrep --config=auto app/
```
